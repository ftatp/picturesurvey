Images have the ability to inspire and bring out the best in us, whether they are funny, sad or beautiful. Over the past five years, I\u2019ve watched in wonder as this community has grown to 500 million, with stories from every corner of the world. With this growth, we want to work diligently to maintain what has kept Instagram positive and safe, especially in the comments on your photos and videos.\n\nThe beauty of the Instagram community is the diversity of its members. All different types of people \u2014 from diverse backgrounds, races, genders, sexual orientations, abilities and more \u2014 call Instagram home, but sometimes the comments on their posts can be unkind. To empower each individual, we need to promote a culture where everyone feels safe to be themselves without criticism or harassment. It\u2019s not only my personal wish to do this, I believe it\u2019s also our responsibility as a company. So, today, we\u2019re taking the next step to ensure Instagram remains a positive place to express yourself.\n\nThe first feature we\u2019re introducing is a keyword moderation tool that anyone can use. Now, when you tap the gear icon on your profile, you\u2019ll find a new Comments tool. This feature lets you list words you consider offensive or inappropriate. Comments with these words will be hidden from your posts. You can choose your own list of words or use default words we\u2019ve provided. This is in addition to the tools we\u2019ve already developed such as swiping to delete comments, reporting inappropriate comments and blocking accounts.\n\nWe know tools aren\u2019t the only solution for this complex problem, but together we can work toward keeping Instagram a safe place for self-expression. My commitment to you is that we will keep building features that safeguard the community and maintain what makes Instagram a positive and creative place for everyone.\n\nTo learn more about comments on Instagram, check out help.instagram.com.\n\nKevin Systrom\nCEO & Co-founder, Instagram"}, {"num_of_comments": 24, "num_of_like": "629,272", "path": "instagram/picture1800.jpg", "like_list": [], "date_time": "Sep 12, 2016", "location": "", "tag_list": ["@kerbito", "@pyermoss", "@kerbito", "@dariothephotog"], "caption": "For Kerby Jean-Raymond (), fashion shows are a chance to invite viewers into the life and mind of a designer. \u201cI tend to break from the typical fashion show format because I always found it boring and sterile,\u201d says the designer of his show for Pyer Moss () on Sunday during New York Fashion Week. \u201cWe walked the viewer through the tedious process of making art and the ridiculousness of having to sell it and all the problems that come with that.\u201d Kerby\u2019s dynamic shows are often among the most talked about moments of the week \u2014 a victory for a designer who was warned about the limits that exist in the industry for people of color. \u201cI always held the belief that if you can\u2019t get your foot in the door, go down the street and build your own house,\u201d says Kerby, who is pictured here after the Pyer Moss show in February 2015. \u201cI\u2019m honored to be amongst a new class of designers who don\u2019t abide by the rules of that glass ceiling.\u201d\nPhoto of  by "}]}
