Some tips to get you started:\nRemember that windows aren't the only transparent objects. Keep an eye out for unique items like paperweights, water glasses, jars and anything that may be made of glass or clear plastic. Just because you can see through an object doesn't mean it's invisible. There's beauty in capturing the way these items distort light and what you see when you look through them. Alternatively, experiment with plain backgrounds and soft light to make your objects seem even more minimal. Vases and jars can be especially fun when photographed this way as their contents seem to float in space.\n\nPROJECT RULES: Please only add the  hashtag to photos taken over this weekend and only submit your own photographs to the project.

From beachside tea parties to doctor's appointments, Jessica is at the ready with her iPhone to capture the magic of being a mom. As she puts it, \"One can easily complain about the frustrations and failures we have as mothers. It's REAL life\u2014but I want to capture the beauty of life, the beauty of being a stay-at-home, the beauty of a simple thing such as light shining through my window. Some of the sweetest comments I've received are, 'I can't wait to become a mother,' and I hope people see that although being a mother is the hardest job one will ever have, it's the best and most beautiful one.\" For more from Jessica and her family, follow .

Some tips to get you started:\n\nFor a photo, you can experiment with staging a scene that best illustrates that motherly advice, whether it's as concrete as sharing a video of a household cleaning trick or abstract as a photo of a symbol from a major life decision. Sometimes, however, faces tell the best stories. Don't be afraid to share a portrait of your mom or the mother figure in your life and share their advice in your caption.\n\nPROJECT RULES: Please only add the  hashtag to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own photographs and videos to the project. Any image or video taken then tagged over the weekend is eligible to be featured right here Monday morning!\n\nFor more examples and inspiration, check out blog.instagram.com.\nFeatured photo by "}, {"num_of_comments": 24, "num_of_like": "341,366", "path": "instagram/picture4000.jpg", "like_list": [], "date_time": "May 10, 2014", "location": "Frieze New York", "tag_list": ["@friezeartfair", "@jeannegr", "@lehmannmaupin", "@hyperallergic", "@paridust", "@simondepury", "#friezeny", "@friezeartfair"], "caption": "From Friday to Monday, May 9-12, fans of fine art head to Randall's Island Park in New York City for the third annual Frieze Art Fair New York ().
