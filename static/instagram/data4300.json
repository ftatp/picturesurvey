The goal this weekend is to take a creative interactive photo or video of your own.\n\nKeep an eye out for heart shapes in the wild. Whether it's a particularly well-shaped leaf, the design in your latte foam or part of a sign, you'll see them everywhere once you start looking. You can also get crafty with this project. Experiment with objects you can mold, gather, carve or arrange into a heart. You can also make a video by showing the whole process. To figure out the arrangement of your shape, place the heart in the center of the composition. Try to crop your photo so that there's about a heart and a half of space between your heart and the edge of your frame.\n\nPROJECT RULES: Please only add the  hashtag to photos or videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own photographs or videos to the project.

Whether you're attending the Winter X Games or simply hitting the slopes with friends, keep these photo tips from X Games photographer Brett Wilhelm () in mind: Know your equipment. Learn to control focus and exposure, especially when shooting bright snowfields or nighttime compositions, and check to see if your device has a burst mode for a better chance at catching an action shot. Take care of your gear by keeping your camera warm until it's time to shoot and using a waterproof case or plastic bag to keep it dry. When setting up your shot, think about where the action will be and find a position that guarantees a clean background to make the subject jump out. Avoid distracting objects in the corners of your frame. Remember that most action sports are judged on height, difficulty and stylistic mastery\u2014try zooming out to show the larger context when your subject is at peak height or performing a trick.

The building housing the baths burned down in 1966 and the site was abandoned, but weathered remnants of the concrete walls and pool remain. \"The second you walk down those stairs it\u2019s as if you are transported to a place lost in time.
