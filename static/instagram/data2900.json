Tourists have flocked to the city for the past two weeks making Munich \u201ceven more cosmopolitan than it is already,\u201d says Tilman, who goes out of his way to photograph Bavarian traditions.\nAn annual tradition at Oktoberfest is the festive prelude \u2013 \u201cEinzug der Wiesn-Wirte.\u201d Tilman says the thousands of people who wait for the parade of flower-decked horse-drawn carriages, marching bands and pompous carts from local breweries come to a calm silence just before the show. And then they explode with excitement: \u201cWhen the first division of the procession arrives, there is no holding back. The music-making and clapping go on and on,\u201d says Tilman. \u201cIt\u2019s a grand tryst of Bavaria\u2019s traditional associations.\u201d\nPhoto by "}, {"num_of_comments": 24, "num_of_like": "809,419", "path": "instagram/picture2894.jpg", "like_list": [], "date_time": "Oct 3, 2015", "location": "", "tag_list": ["#WWIM12", "#todayimet", "#whoifollow", "#todayimet", "#WWIM12", "#todayimet", "@hilda.parra"], "caption": "This weekend, we\u2019re putting the Weekend Hashtag Project on hold for the 12th Worldwide InstaMeet.\n\nThe theme of  is to share  portraits of the people you meet this weekend.

The tradition further carried on into lunch boxes when her daughter started going to school. \u201cThis is how I\u2019ve been raising my daughter all along, and seeing how well she\u2019s grown up, I feel like I\u2019m doing the right thing,\u201d she says. \u201cNo matter how old my daughter gets \u2014 even when she moves up to high school and beyond \u2014 I will forever continue to decorate the meals I cook for her.\u201d \n\nPhoto by "}, {"num_of_comments": 24, "num_of_like": "864,128", "path": "instagram/picture2896.jpg", "like_list": [], "date_time": "Oct 2, 2015", "location": "", "tag_list": ["@balletandphotos", "#worldballetday", "@balletandphotos"], "caption": "Laurent Liotardo () had his eye on becoming a ballet dancer when he was just 10 years old. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the easiest choice to deal with at school, as the other kids would make fun of me.

Still, there is a vernacular specific to pencil connoisseurs. \u201cPoint retention means how long you can write with it until you have to sharpen it again.
