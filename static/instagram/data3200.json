Frame your shot, hit record, then hold your camera as still as possible while you capture the action. Alternatively, stage a scene as you would a photo then stage motion within the fixed frame, such as a person walking through the frame or a hand reaching in to remove something.

Los Angeles graphic designer Kyle Huber () has been highlighting his own turtles in creative ways every week for the past three years through his  series. While Kyle\u2019s day-to-day shots include drone-captured aerial videos of the California coast and vibrant, colorful photos that experiment with perspective, each week without fail there will be a cameo appearance by at least one of his seven red-eared sliders: Shelly, Myrtle, Franklin, Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello and Michelangelo. \u201cI got my first baby turtle when I was 12 years old and have been obsessed with them ever since,\u201d Kyle shares. \u201cComing up with a new and original turtle photo each week can be challenging, so occasionally I have to bring a couple with me on my adventures so I can photograph them in new places.

It\u2019s not about the image \u2014 and for me, that\u2019s the real beauty of photography. I\u2019m not sure that any other art medium has this sort of character, because it\u2019s about the experience that we go through while we work. We work in a certain environment, or with particular people, and that experience that enriches us is stronger than any single photograph.\u201d He continues, \u201cI will die one day \u2014 we\u2019ll all die one day \u2014 and I need to show other people what I\u2019ve gone through in my life. That\u2019s something quite powerful, I think.\u201d Photo by "}, {"num_of_comments": 24, "num_of_like": "709,163", "path": "instagram/picture3200.jpg", "like_list": [], "date_time": "May 13, 2015", "location": "", "tag_list": ["@nabsd.art", "@nabsd.art", "@instagramES", "@nabsd.art"], "caption": "\u201cImagine someone with many imaginary friends who invites them to drink tea and have a photo shoot. That\u2019s my artistic style,\u201d says a Mexican artist known as Nabs D (). \u201cWe would have that tea in Pluto, because that\u2019s the planet of the rejected, and I would invite my friend the paranoid, my other friend the hypochondriac and my friend who always laughs when someone trips over. I would very much like to hear their conversation.\u201d Recently Nabs painted several characters from the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d book series for an exhibition at the Museo del Juguete (the Mexican Museum of Antique Toys) in Mexico City, which is currently showcasing the largest collection of objects from the wizard\u2019s world. \u201cHe is a hero I can identify with because he is clumsy. He is not the typical, perfect hero and I like that,\u201d she says.\n\nIn her paintings Nabs tries to reflect esoteric themes. \u201cI feel like some of my pieces are kind of enigmatic and I\u2019d like people to go see them and try to decipher the hidden meaning.\u201d For more art from Nabs, follow \n\nFor more stories from around the Spanish-speaking community, follow .\n\nPhoto by "}]}
