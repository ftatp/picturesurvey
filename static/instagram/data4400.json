Dating back to the very earliest cave paintings, self portraiture became popular in the during the Early Renaissance (in part due to the rise in availability of mirrors). It wasn't until four centuries later, however, that the first photographic self-portrait emerged. As cameras became more advanced and readily available over the years, so too did self-portraits become increasingly more common. Now, with cameras almost always within our reach, a self portrait can happen anytime, anywhere.\n\nThe goal this weekend is to tap into this rich artistic tradition and stage a creative self portrait. Some tips to get you started:\n\nLighting can make or break your self portrait. Look for soft, natural light near a window or\u2014if you're feeling adventurous\u2014come up with your own lighting set-up. Your background is also very important. Look for a plain or patterned background for a more traditional portrait. Find an interesting location or create a scene in the background to tell a story. Finally, you don't have to be holding your phone to capture the photo. Explore using photo timer apps and mobile tripods to take the photo on your own. You can also have a friend step in to snap the final photo once you've set everything up.\n\nPROJECT RULES: Please only add the  hashtag to photos taken over this weekend and only submit your own photographs to the project.

Outside of his day job as a freelance digital media consultant and photographer, Rob gets his thrills scaling New York City's tallest bridges, trams, roofs and skyscrapers to shoot the city from above. \"I first developed an interest in photography shooting street portraits of the people of New York City. Then I realized that I was really interested in the city itself as a subject,\" he says. \"I discovered that the higher up and further away I got, the more the immense city was reduced to shapes, lines and angles. There is a peace and universality in that geometry that I really like. Somehow it makes the city more human.\" Want to refine the compositions of your cityscapes? Here are Rob's tips: Pay attention to depth of field in your frame. Try to include a distinct foreground, middle ground and background, which helps create a sense of scale and distance. A mix of different building heights helps too. Look for an interesting street angle within the buildings that will draw your viewers into the photo. Avoid shooting straight in front of you and placing the primary subject in the middle of the frame. To add atmosphere and mood to cityscape shots, shoot on cloudy or rainy days. Hard, bright light is not your friend! Stay safe and law-abiding, of course, but if you're trying to get to a building's upper levels, skip the elevator and look for the stairs. You'll be surprised where you end up.\n\nTo view more photos and videos from a bird\u2019s-eye perspective of New York, be sure to follow ."}, {"num_of_comments": 24, "num_of_like": "283,726", "path": "instagram/picture4393.jpg", "like_list": [], "date_time": "Nov 22, 2013", "location": "", "tag_list": ["@latingrammys", "@juanes01", "@juanes01", "@ricky_martin", "@nataliafourcade", "@lesliegrace", "@jesseyjoy", "@eldasa", "@UnivisionPremios", "@latingrammys"], "caption": "The evening of Thursday, November 21, marks the 14th annual Latin Grammy Awards (), a celebration of the best musical achievements for works recorded in Spanish or Portuguese.
