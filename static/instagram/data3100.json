Some tips to get you started:\nKeep your setting in mind as you stage your shot. On a windy day, the breeze moving through long hair can lend itself to beautiful video portraits \u2014 especially if filmed in slow motion. Sharpen your street photography skills and keep an eye out for interesting hairstyles in the wild. Snap from afar or respectfully approach and ask to take a portrait. Or, if you can\u2019t find anything interesting, get creative. Grab a willing friend and break out the hairspray to see what you can create. Finally, as with all photos of people, keep light in mind as you shoot. Take advantage of an overcast sky or nearby window for softer portrait light, or go out into direct sun for bold shadows.\n\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the  hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own photographs and videos to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged image or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured Monday morning.\n\nFor more examples and inspiration, check out blog.instagram.com.\nFeatured photo by "}, {"num_of_comments": 24, "num_of_like": "798,704", "path": "instagram/picture3054.jpg", "like_list": [], "date_time": "Jul 17, 2015", "location": "", "tag_list": ["@twinleaves", "@twinleaves"], "caption": "For Hitoshi Kobayashi () from Tokyo, Japan, the sceneries that excite his photographic endeavors are not the urban landscape or the modern architecture found inside the city center, but rather the decades-old stores and houses which he discovers in suburban neighborhoods. \u201cI\u2019ve just been capturing whatever that catches my attention in the streets, but come to think of it, I think I\u2019m naturally drawn to things that tell stories about people\u2019s lives,\u201d he says. \u201cTimeworn buildings, overused dustpans and even small inventions like attaching a broken door with a string \u2014 these are the kinds of things that I find fascinating,\u201d explains Hitoshi.

Try to capture the essence of a personality, and don't be afraid to capture unscripted moments as well. Clothes and setting also help convey a sense of personality. Keep that in mind when seeking out real-life characters to capture or when creating a character of your own. Don't forget the importance of body language.
