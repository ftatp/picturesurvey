Whether among friends or a crowd of strangers, the best candid shots are ones where you feel as if the camera was never there. As you shoot, try to blend in and keep your camera out of the way. Make sure the flash is off, and try shooting from the hip. Find a space with a background that interests you, frame your composition then wait for an unusual moment to pass through to complete the shot. Finally, respect your local laws and the people you're photographing. Only shoot in public spaces and be kind if someone notices you and asks not to be photographed.\n\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the  hashtag only to photos taken over this weekend and only submit your own photographs to the project. Any tagged image taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured Monday morning.\n\nFor more examples and inspiration, check out blog.instagram.com.\nFeatured photo by "}, {"num_of_comments": 24, "num_of_like": "688,897", "path": "instagram/picture3287.jpg", "like_list": [], "date_time": "Apr 3, 2015", "location": "", "tag_list": ["@madewithluvca", "@madewithluvca"], "caption": "Canadian stay-at-home mom turned artist Sarah Henrich () has developed a keen interest in connecting kid-friendly art with Judaism.

Little did Shinjiro know that Maru would become one of the most adored pets on Instagram \u2014 and open Shinjiro up to a community full of new friends.\nTokyo designer Daisuke Kujiraoka, who goes by the name Halno (), shares a series of \u201clevitation\u201d photos that he started with a group of friends he met through Instagram. \u201cWe were exploring aesthetics that would be fun for us to shoot, and the broomstick levitation captures eventually became my trademark,\u201d he says. Since then, the works of his team have sparked the curiosity of many people, and the group has recently begun to share their creative process more broadly though InstaMeets.\n\nLast February, Shinjiro, Maru, Halno and Halno\u2019s team met up for the first time, where they spent an entire afternoon doing a photo shoot. \u201cWe told Shinjiro about the images we had in mind, and Maru just followed Shinjiro\u2019s instructions,\u201d says Halno. \u201cIt was impressive to see how much friendship, love and trust exist between the two.\u201d Photo by "}, {"num_of_comments": 24, "num_of_like": "698,827", "path": "instagram/picture3298.jpg", "like_list": [], "date_time": "Mar 29, 2015", "location": "", "tag_list": ["@choudharyravi", "@freegrassfarmer", "@hervsfree", "@mitsuguuu", "@hamedbarei", "@andresdelima", "@mi_noir", "@unmaderhyme", "@hnato_nf", "@andresdelima"], "caption": "Every Sunday, we look back on the week and select some of our favorite images from emerging voices across the globe.

It moves the way it wants to,\u201d says Whitney Mitchell (), who has lived in the southern city for nearly eight years.\n\nGradually, Whitney found New Orleans bringing out her creative side. \u201cThere is a magic in this city I couldn\u2019t even begin to justify with words,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s a feeling of creation with no fear of failing. The city lent itself to me to just try, to just live and take life easy.\u201d Whitney\u2019s photographs often take shape as bright, strong portraits of the women in her life set against the vibrant colors of the city\u2019s buildings. \u201cThere is so much in life that tells people to feel and look a certain way, or that beauty is measured by a \u2018pretty scale,\u2019\u201d she explains. \u201cEach of the women trust me to help them feel beautiful when they don\u2019t outside of a meticulously thought-out selfie. I want to show sexiness in line with power and blackness in line with holistic beauty.\u201d Photo by "}, {"num_of_comments": 24, "num_of_like": "642,530", "path": "instagram/picture3300.jpg", "like_list": [], "date_time": "Mar 28, 2015", "location": "", "tag_list": ["@prinkasaraswati", "@prinkasaraswati"], "caption": "When Prinka Saraswati () makes a portrait, she\u2019s looking for the person inside a person. \u201cI try to capture their real personalities,\u201d says Prinka, 21, who makes a living in Surabaya, Indonesia, as a kindergarten teacher, English tutor and photographer. \u201cSeeing their insincere laugh when someone tells a lame joke or silent smile when they receive a text.
