Though Cinco de Mayo as it has come to be known is celebrated primarily by Mexican-American communities in the United States, the holiday's roots begin with the 1862 Battle of Puebla in Puebla, Mexico. In the wake of a series of wars throughout the mid-1800s, the French army marched on Veracruz, sending the Mexican president and government into retreat. At the small city of Puebla, however, Mexican resistance defeated the French army despite being heavily outnumbered. Though not a national holiday in Mexico, the town of Puebla marks the day as an official holiday and celebrates with parades and festivities. Drawing on the bolstered morale and pride from the victory, Mexican-Americans in the western United States first adopted Cinco de Mayo as a holiday in the 1860s. Today, Cinco de Mayo stands as an important celebration of cultural heritage and is celebrated with festivals and performances of traditional mariachi and baile folkl\u00f3rico in cities with large Mexican-American communities such as Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco and Houston.\n\nTo view more photos and videos from the Cinco de Mayo celebrations, tap the blue location text above and browse the  hashtag.\n\nPhoto by "}, {"num_of_comments": 24, "num_of_like": "304,605", "path": "instagram/picture4011.jpg", "like_list": [], "date_time": "May 6, 2014", "location": "", "tag_list": ["@robertlarsen", "@cjespersen", "@deradjad", "@aimeepower", "@lilfoxx", "@burnashburn", "@ukrainianprincess21", "@instafraner", "@suzysaysrelax", "#WHPsilhouetted"], "caption": "Every Monday we share some of our favorite Weekend Hashtag Project submissions on our blog at blog.instagram.com.

Inside the village, narrow alleys spread throughout the city like a maze where people are likely to run into multi-colored buildings, quirky art installations and stylish galleries. The village, also called Taegukdo Village, was founded in 1918 when thousands of people, many of them followers of the Taegukdo religion, fled to the war-free area of Busan. As a village settled by war refugees, it existed as one of the poorest areas in the region until very recently. In 2009, the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism launched a project to preserve the village, turning it into the artistic community it is today. Now, the picturesque scenery the village provides is known to be a great place for photos, and many local and visiting Instagrammers alike come to document and share the art found all over the city.\n\nFor more photos and videos from Gamcheon Culture Village, tap the blue location text above.\n\nPhoto by "}, {"num_of_comments": 24, "num_of_like": "296,077", "path": "instagram/picture4058.jpg", "like_list": [], "date_time": "Apr 16, 2014", "location": "", "tag_list": ["@gdax", "@gdax", "@gdax"], "caption": "\u0f51\u0f42\u0f7a\u0f0b\u0f60\u0f51\u0f74\u0f53\u0f0b\u0f51\u0f56\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f55\u0fb1\u0f74\u0f42, or Gedun Wangchuk, () is a Buddhist monk living in Tibet, where he uses Instagram to share scenes from his daily life atop one of the highest locations on earth.

The goal this weekend is to take a creative video using bokeh: the blurred part of your image that's out of focus. Some tips to get you started:\n\nTo create bokeh, get up close to a nearby object and lock your focus on it. You can usually do this by tapping the screen to set the focus and holding your finger there to lock it. After you've locked your focus, frame a scene that's farther away and it should be out of focus and pleasantly blurry. Since your video will be out of focus, think about shapes, colors and movement as the primary elements of your video. Things that are normally very recognizable may become delightfully abstract! Finally, videos like these tend to be very bright, so consider shooting at twilight or nighttime to compensate.\n\nPROJECT RULES: Please only add the  hashtag to videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own videos to the project.

Some tips to get you started: Hands can be extremely expressive. Spend some time observing people's body language to get an idea for how they hold their hands depending on their mood and emotions. Remember that our hands are constantly working. Whether they're painting, sewing, writing, typing or building, keep an eye out for how you can capture hands at work\u2014especially with video. Finally, age can play a big part in telling the story of your photo or video. A child's youthful hands can convey joy and excitement, whereas older hands lined with the wrinkles of time can create a more tranquil scene.\n\nPROJECT RULES: Please only add the  hashtag to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own photographs and videos to the project. Any image or video taken then tagged over the weekend is eligible to be featured right here Monday morning!\nFor more examples and inspiration, check out blog.instagram.com.\nFeatured photo by "}, {"num_of_comments": 24, "num_of_like": "244,052", "path": "instagram/picture4087.jpg", "like_list": [], "date_time": "Apr 5, 2014", "location": "", "tag_list": ["@stephen_vick", "@stephen_vick", "@bluebottle", "@stephen_vick"], "caption": "As the buyer for Blue Bottle Coffee's green, not-yet-roasted coffee, Stephen Vick () travels to every corner of the globe. \"I use Instagram to document my travels and show interesting, beautiful, quirky things that I see when I'm out in the world,\" says Stephen.\n\nIn the past decade, Stephen has visited more than 17 countries in a variety of roles, from teaching farmers best practices to working on the construction of more economical and sustainable processing facilities.
