Some tips to get you started: Chairs come in all shapes and sizes. Look for a unique chair or a chair you find particularly beautiful and photograph it in a way that emphasizes its lines and shape. Think about the significance of an empty chair and the story you want your photo to tell. A single chair on its own can be inviting or lonely. You can also arrange a group of chairs to imply a different kind of story. Finally, setting can be very important for this project. A simple or solid-color background will emphasize the shape of the chair. The chair's natural setting (a home, restaurant or office for example) can help tell its story, but don't be afraid to take a chair to an unlikely setting to create a surprising scene.\n\nPROJECT RULES: Please only add the  hashtag to photos taken over this weekend and only submit your own photographs to the project.

Some tips to get you started: Dancers often like to pose for the camera. Have a friend or acquaintance who's a professional dancer? Offer to let him or her use your photos and videos in exchange for posing. Remember, though, that anyone can be a dancer! Turn on the music, grab your friends and family and capture the fun of the moment. Your setting will be key to the kind of story your photo or video tells. For a more classic look, seek out dramatic light and empty spaces. (You may even be able to shoot in a dance school or studio if you secure advance permission.) If you want a more contemporary feel, seek out somewhere where dance would be unexpected like a crowded street, supermarket or wherever your imagination may take you. Finally, if you're shooting video, try to limit the amount of motion. It's difficult to follow a moving dancer if your camera is moving, too, so try and keep your phone still while your dancer moves (or vice versa). PROJECT RULES: Please only add the  hashtag to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own photographs and videos to the project.

Ballet poses can look completely different depending on your point of view. If you ask a ballerina to stand in an arabesque and walk around her, providing she doesn't move, you will get different shots and angles. I shoot in ballet halls. Often there are large rooms with large windows and nothing to interrupt your view\u2014lots of natural light for the dancer's body to catch. In ballet, there is often an important special moment in the middle of a move. If you are interested in ballet, pay close attention and speak to the dancers so you know when to push the shutter. The human body is like clay: you can mould it. And the body of a ballerina is super soft, like plastic clay, which can be very beautiful.\" For more photos and videos of Darian Volkova's dancers, browse the  hashtag and follow  on Instagram.

If you're filming with the Instagram camera, make sure Cinema Mode is on for a super stable video. Even though you have a fixed perspective, the setting brings your video to life. For example, bare feet walking through a field tell a very different story than high heels walking down a busy city sidewalk. Finally, keep your ears open as you shoot. Whether it's traffic rushing past, voices in the background or the sound of the ocean, the sounds around you add context to your film.\n\nPROJECT RULES: Please only add the  hashtag to videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own videos to the project.
