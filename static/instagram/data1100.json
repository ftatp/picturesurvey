And while that hasn't completely changed, I think in the past few years, more women are getting the recognition they deserve, and then inspiring other women. There's still a long way to go before it's even remotely equal, but I've definitely felt a change. It's very important to me to document people involved in punk and hardcore who have been underrepresented in the past. I can think of so many women who have been forgotten by history \u2014 it's heartbreaking. In twenty years, if someone wants to know what hardcore was like in the US in 2017, they're going to see a room full of women participating and supporting each other.
