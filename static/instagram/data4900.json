Jefferson (1743-1826) holds a key position in the history of the United States as one of the nation's Founding Fathers. As the primary author of the Declaration of Independence, the nation's first Secretary of State, second vice-president and the third president of the United States, his legacy still echoes forward to this day.\n\nDuring his presidency, Jefferson oversaw the Louisiana Purchase, which expanded the United States by 828,000 square miles (2,144,510 square km). He also commissioned the Lewis and Clark expedition shortly thereafter to explore the newly aquired territory over the course of two years.\n\nFor more photos from Jefferson's legacy, check out the Instagram blog.\n\nPhoto by "}, {"num_of_comments": 24, "num_of_like": "258,633", "path": "instagram/picture4835.jpg", "like_list": [], "date_time": "Apr 13, 2013", "location": "", "tag_list": ["#Songkran", "#Songkan", "#Thingyan", "@adhitsetiawan"], "caption": "Countries throughout Southeast Asia are celebrating the New Year this weekend!
