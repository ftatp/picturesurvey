The exteriors of libraries vary widely and are often photogenic, and the inside spaces can be filled with small nooks where people can read as well as larger spaces meant for work or study. The most important part of any library is, of course, its books. Get creative with ways of photographing books with special attention to all of the different colors as well as the patterns and lines that emerge from the shelves. Lastly, libraries often serve as exhibition spaces for local history, rare manuscripts or even art installations.

Over the next 28 years, Morgan created one of the most ambitious architectural projects in American history: Hearst Castle.\nThe home contains over 160 rooms and boasts tennis courts, a movie theater, an airfield and 127 acres (.5 square kilometers) of gardens. Most iconic, however, are the property's two ornate pools\u2014one indoor and one outdoor\u2014that Morgan designed with Hearst's love of Roman antiquity in mind.
