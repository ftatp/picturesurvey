The goal this weekend is to capture creative videos or photos showing a visual interpretation of a sound. Some tips to get you started:\n\nYou can find sound almost everywhere. It can come from things close to us, like teapots or people laughing, but also from objects in our recent past, like phone dials, typewriters or tape recorders. When people see your photo, you want them to immediately hear a sound in their minds. Let a unique noise around you draw your attention, then frame your shot to show the action and best convey the sound. For video, avoid music in favor of the ambient sounds in everyday life. From the roar of a train leaving the station to the strike of a match, seek to capture footage where sound and motion come together to bring a moment to life.\n\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the  hashtag only to photos and videos taken this weekend and only submit your own photographs and videos to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged image or video taken this weekend is eligible to be featured Monday morning.\n\nFor more examples and inspiration, check out blog.instagram.com.\n\nFeatured photo by "}, {"num_of_comments": 24, "num_of_like": "501,434", "path": "instagram/picture3302.jpg", "like_list": [], "date_time": "Mar 27, 2015", "location": "", "tag_list": ["@dana_arr", "@dana_arr"], "caption": "For California native Dana Roth (), the experience of living and working as a Peace Corps volunteer in Senegal, West Africa, has been nothing short of transformative. \u201cGoing into this, I really didn\u2019t have an idea of what I was going to do in the future,\u201d says Dana. \u201cWhile I hoped that I\u2019d be on a journey of self-discovery, up until recently I thought maybe that was a silly idea.

Our project takes its inspiration from Balazs Gardi (), a Hungarian photojournalist who has spent the past decade photographing water in all its forms around the world.

If you don\u2019t have a waterproof case, just use a few strips of gaffer's tape to seal the speakers and other places where water could get in, and hold onto your phone tightly. Always be prepared to grab moments that never come back, but when you are in control, you think first and then shoot. Understanding the message you want your photo to convey is just as important as aesthetics.\u201d PROJECT RULES: Please add the  hashtag only to photos and videos taken this weekend and only submit your own photographs and videos to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights.

Some tips to get you started:\nConnect the beginning and end of your video by starting and stopping your recording on the same backdrop. For example, set your camera in a fixed location while your subject moves into and out of the frame. This will create a seamless transition during playback on loop. Next, keep an eye out for natural repetition around you. If you film something that's constantly moving, you can create an infinite loop. For example, a video of a train running through your scene will appear to run on forever\u2014just be sure to hold your phone still. Alternatively, use the end point in unexpected ways. Play with creative transitions, and it's perfectly normal to try a few times until you get it right.\n\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the  hashtag only to videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own videos to the project.

Nasrin recently returned to this East African archipelago after spending most of her life in North America. Her portraits and photos of everyday life capture Zanzibar\u2019s distinct architecture, customs, music and clothing.\n\nOpportunities to capture the essence of island life are many, says Nasrin, from the historic narrow winding streets of Stone Town to the clove, nutmeg and cinnamon stands that helped Zanzibar come to be known as \u201cSpice Island.\u201d However, the coastline and the people that make their living from its waters are among Nasrin\u2019s favorite subjects. She uses portraiture as a way to strike up conversation with the fisherman and sea farmers collecting sea life to sell at the market. \u201cThey share a little of part of their lives and I develop a certain connection with them.\u201d To learn more about Nasrin\u2019s favorite spots to capture life in Zanzibar, visit blog.instagram.com and follow .\n\nPhoto by "}, {"num_of_comments": 24, "num_of_like": "555,777", "path": "instagram/picture3376.jpg", "like_list": [], "date_time": "Feb 21, 2015", "location": "", "tag_list": ["#WHPlocalstory", "#WHPlocalstory", "@joyfilledwander"], "caption": "Weekend Hashtag Project: \n\nThe goal this weekend is to take creative photos and videos of the moments happening all around you that you might normally overlook.
