Think about what making tea could look like from a kettle's point of view, or what the world looks like to a small animal. Taking unusual point-of-view (POV) shots can require getting your phone into some interesting places. Don't be afraid to tie down, tape or otherwise mount your phone to objects for a different perspective. Finally, for the most stable results, make sure you have Cinema mode turned on if you're recording with Instagram, or capture video using Hyperlapse at 1x speed.\n\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the  hashtag only to videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own videos to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights.

According to Brooklyn Instagrammer Matthew Ferri (), the hashtag's creator, \u201cI've always been drawn to visuals that evoke a rush of energy and emotion. When I was learning photography, I used to see a lot of panned shots around the internet and always wondered how they were achieved. I just really liked the energy in the photos and decided that I would try to get other people involved.\u201d With that in mind, the goal this weekend is to capture creative photos that employ a panning technique to convey motion. Here are some of Matthew's tips to get you started: \u201cFor starters, you're going to want to find a subject that is moving fast (a car, bike, skier/snowboarder, runner, etc). Check your surroundings\u2014what would make for a good background? Try to find some lights or variations in colors, as they'll end up being blurred, creating an abstract backdrop.\u201d Next, he advises, \u201cUsing the native camera app, you'll want to follow your subject as they pass you. If you're standing on a street corner and a car is approaching you, aim the camera at the car and follow it while pressing the shutter button. Don't stop following the subject until a second or two after you've pressed it.\u201d And finally, Matt reminds, \u201cDon't be afraid of failure. Pans may take a lot of of attempts to get right (I've taken hundreds, if not thousands), so keep at it and have fun!\u201d For more examples and inspiration, check out blog.instagram.com.\nFeatured photo by "}, {"num_of_comments": 24, "num_of_like": "678,381", "path": "instagram/picture3452.jpg", "like_list": [], "date_time": "Jan 16, 2015", "location": "", "tag_list": ["@super_pringle", "#beardiesofinstagram", "@super_pringle"], "caption": "With a name like \u201cbearded dragon,\u201d it\u2019s hard to conjure up images of a friendly and adorable pet.

Finally, remember to share the details of your resolution in the caption.\n\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the  hashtag only to photos taken over this weekend and only submit your own photographs to the project.
