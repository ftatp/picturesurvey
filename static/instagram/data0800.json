This weekend, the goal is to take photos and videos of the good food and better company you find in the kitchen, as in this featured photo by Hedi Gharrat (). Here are some tips to get you started:\nVisit the kitchens where your favorite meals are made: Re-create a family recipe at a relative\u2019s house, capture the tried and true pots and pans hanging above your kitchen sink or the scars on a friend\u2019s cheese board at Friday night dinner.\nPeople tend to gather in a home\u2019s kitchen. Record Boomerangs or videos that capture the energy of a group of family members and friends around food and drink.\nKitchens don\u2019t have to exist between four built walls. What are some nontraditional, makeshift kitchens you found yourself in this weekend, like a street food cart or a campfire?\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the  hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights.
