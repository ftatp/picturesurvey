It\u2019s more important than ever to strengthen our commitment to safety and kindness.\nOver time, we\u2019ve launched a number of tools to help you manage the comments experience, and today we\u2019re introducing more. Starting today, if your account is public, you\u2019ll see a new way to choose who can comment on your posts \u2014 from everyone to just groups of people, like people you follow or your followers. Also, whether your account is public or private, you\u2019ll be able to block other accounts from commenting on your posts. In June, we launched a filter to block certain offensive comments in English, today we are expanding this filter to Arabic, French, German and Portuguese. The filter will improve over time, enabling the community\u2019s experience of sharing to improve as well.\nWe\u2019re continuing to provide mental health resources to you when you need them most. If you see someone going through a difficult time or in need of support during a live broadcast, you can report it anonymously. The person will see a message offering help with options to talk to a helpline, reach out to a friend or get other tips and support. We have teams working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, around the world to respond.\nWe feel as strongly about creating a safe and welcoming environment today as we did when our community was just getting started.
