First, Instagram is now a global community of one billion! Since our launch in 2010, we\u2019ve watched with amazement as the community has flourished and grown. This is a major accomplishment \u2014 so from all of us at Instagram, thank you!\nSecond, we\u2019re announcing our most exciting feature to date: IGTV, a new app for watching long-form, vertical video from your favorite Instagram creators, like LaurDIY () posting her newest project or King Bach () sharing his latest comedy skit. While there\u2019s a stand-alone IGTV app, you\u2019ll also be able to watch from within the Instagram app so the entire community of one billion can use it from the very start.\nIGTV is different in a few ways. First, it\u2019s built for how you actually use your phone, so videos are full screen and vertical. Also, unlike on Instagram, videos aren\u2019t limited to one minute. Instead, each video can be up to an hour long.\nWe made it simple, too. Just like turning on the TV, IGTV starts playing as soon as you open the app. You don\u2019t have to search to start watching content from people you already follow on Instagram and others you might like based on your interests. You can swipe up to discover more \u2014 switch between \u201cFor You,\u201d \u201cFollowing,\u201d \u201cPopular\u201d and \u201cContinue Watching.\u201d You can also like, comment and send videos to friends in Direct.\nAlso like TV, IGTV has channels. But, in IGTV, the creators are the channels. When you follow a creator on Instagram, their IGTV channel will show up for you to watch. Anyone can be a creator \u2014 you can upload your own IGTV videos in the app or on the web to start your own channel.\nInstagram has always been a place to connect with the people who inspire, educate and entertain you every day. With your help, IGTV begins a new chapter of video on Instagram. We hope it brings you closer to the people and things you love.\nIGTV will be rolling out globally over the next few weeks on iOS and Android."}, {"num_of_comments": 24, "num_of_like": "1,045,915", "path": "instagram/picture0105.jpg", "like_list": [], "date_time": "Jun 20, 2018", "location": "Madh Island", "tag_list": ["@devdxb", "#WHPplay"], "caption": "Photo by \nWhat better backdrop for some impromptu yoga? \ud83e\uddd8\u200d\u2642\ufe0f "}, {"num_of_comments": 23, "num_of_like": "957,173", "path": "instagram/picture0106.jpg", "like_list": [], "date_time": "Jun 20, 2018", "location": "Havana, Cuba", "tag_list": ["@ts_xiv", "@ts_xiv", "#WHPplay"], "caption": "Photo by \nTrisikh Sanguanbun () paused in the middle of a lunchtime soccer game with local kids in Havana to take a quick photo. \u201cNo matter what stage of life you\u2019re in, we all need to play,\u201d he says. \u201cThese kids reminded me to stay youthful and healthy through the game we all love, soccer.\u201d \u26bd\ufe0f "}, {"num_of_comments": 24, "num_of_like": "957,173", "path": "instagram/picture0107.jpg", "like_list": [], "date_time": "Jun 20, 2018", "location": "Chicago, Illinois", "tag_list": ["@cshimala", "@cshimala", "#WHPplay"], "caption": "Video by \n\u201cI\u2019ve called this view home for over 10 years, and I\u2019m still fascinated with how the weather plays with the city,\u201d says Chicago-based photographer Craig Shimala (). \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get much better than watching lightning dance across the skyline.\u201d\u26a1\ufe0f\nFollow along for more of our favorites from last weekend\u2019s hashtag project, ."}, {"num_of_comments": 22, "num_of_like": "774,688", "path": "instagram/picture0108.jpg", "like_list": [], "date_time": "Jun 19, 2018", "location": "Venice Skatepark", "tag_list": ["@toddler777", "#WHPplay"], "caption": "Photo by \nCatching some air along the California coast. \ud83e\udd19 "}, {"num_of_comments": 24, "num_of_like": "490,221", "path": "instagram/picture0109.jpg", "like_list": [], "date_time": "Jun 19, 2018", "location": "Singapore", "tag_list": ["@suspendtime", "#WHPplay"], "caption": "Photo by \nShadow play on a colorful court for ."}, {"num_of_comments": 24, "num_of_like": "916,761", "path": "instagram/picture0110.jpg", "like_list": [], "date_time": "Jun 19, 2018", "location": "Lake Keowee", "tag_list": ["@otis_unleashed", "#WHPplay", "#WHPplay"], "caption": "Photo by \nJumping into  with a splash. \ud83d\udc36\nFollow along for more of our favorites from last weekend\u2019s hashtag project, ."}, {"num_of_comments": 24, "num_of_like": "1,494,824", "path": "instagram/picture0111.jpg", "like_list": [], "date_time": "Jun 18, 2018", "location": "London, United Kingdom", "tag_list": ["@davidbeckham", "@brooklynbeckham", "@unicef", "#FathersDay"], "caption": "For David Beckham (), the joys of fatherhood are the simple things: getting up with his kids in the morning, walking them to school, playing football in the park. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of each of my four children,\u201d says David, whose eldest son Brooklyn () was born when David was 23. \u201cEach with their own personality from such an early age, they are incredible individuals in their own right.\u201d\nDavid\u2019s top advice for new parents is to be present. \u201cIt is the greatest gift you can give your children,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me, and many of the mums and dads I\u2019ve spoken to about parenting over the years, it comes down to two things: love and fear.
