According to biographer Walter Hooper, Lewis was fascinated by ancient history, and Narni\u2014named \u201cNarnia\u201d in Roman times\u2014was highlighted by the children's author in his personal atlas.\n\nWhether Lewis visited Narni has never been confirmed, but even today, its cobblestone streets and castle fortress look like they belong in a magical, medieval novel. And while there are no mythical, talking creatures roaming the land, Narni still feels like a place pulled straight out of our childhood imaginations.\nPhoto by \n\nFor more enchanting images from Narni, tap the blue location text above and browse the  hashtag."}, {"num_of_comments": 24, "num_of_like": "536,567", "path": "instagram/picture3785.jpg", "like_list": [], "date_time": "Aug 17, 2014", "location": "", "tag_list": ["@peter__lopez", "@ale_sagae", "@ana_schr", "@oscarsboss", "@fepparodrigues", "@cidadepretoebranco", "@joemagers", "@fcomata", "@heyfeelix", "@peter__lopez"], "caption": "Every Sunday we post a weekly roundup on our blog (blog.instagram.com) featuring some of our favorite photos and videos from the week.

His life as Rubber Legz began when an early back injury forced him to take a different approach, shifting his focus from acrobatics to flexibility. He started watching contortion videos and integrated elements of yoga into his breakdance moves. Rauf is now a full-time dancer with his stage group, Flying Steps, who are currently on tour in Germany. He says he wants to \"express pure and beautiful things\" with his dancing and credits the Instagram community as a motivation for pushing the boundaries of his art\u2014and flexibility.\n\nFor more breakdance contortionism, follow .\n\nPhoto by "}, {"num_of_comments": 24, "num_of_like": "336,093", "path": "instagram/picture3787.jpg", "like_list": [], "date_time": "Aug 16, 2014", "location": "", "tag_list": ["@letasobierajski", "@wadejeffree", "@wadejeffree", "@letasobierajski", "@wadejeffree"], "caption": "\u201cUsually we send each other ideas, sketches and imagery throughout the week leading up to our shoot,\u201d says Leta Sobierajski (), who collaborates with partner Wade Jeffree () on \u201cComplements,\u201d a weekly series of unconventional portraits. \u201cWe\u2019re inspired both by hilarious couple photography from the Internet and beautiful imagery from couples in history.\u201d Wade, a graphic designer, and Leta, an art director, had been looking for a way to collaborate and decided to explore their creativity\u2014and relationship\u2014through collaborative portraits shot in their Brooklyn apartment. \u201cThe portraiture often becomes surreal, funny and romantic,\u201d says Leta, \u201cand it helps depict our personalities and the way we think together.\u201d To see more imaginative portraits from Wade and Leta, follow  and .\n\nPhoto by "}, {"num_of_comments": 24, "num_of_like": "250,010", "path": "instagram/picture3788.jpg", "like_list": [], "date_time": "Aug 16, 2014", "location": "", "tag_list": ["#WHPtodayimet", "#WHPtodayimet", "@imjomy"], "caption": "Weekend Hashtag Project: \n\nThe goal this weekend is to get outside of your comfort zone, make a new friend and share a portrait with his or her story in your caption. Some tips to get you started:\n\nThis project is as much about the caption as it is the photo. Approach someone, introduce yourself and only ask to take a portrait after you've been able to chat for a while. As you talk with people, don't be afraid to ask surprising questions: ask about their pasts, learn about their goals and try to discover what inspires them. If you're not feeling up to chatting with strangers, strike up a conversation with a coworker or neighbor you've always wanted to get to know better. For those starting school, use this project as an opportunity to meet new classmates, people in your dorm or even teachers and professors. Finally, when shooting your portrait, think about how the photo can help tell the person's story. Elements like environment, body language and even the lighting can say a lot, so be sure to keep them in mind.\n\nPROJECT RULES: Please only add the  hashtag to photos taken over this weekend and only submit your own photographs to the project. Any tagged image taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured Monday morning.\n\nFor more examples and inspiration, check out blog.instagram.com.\nFeatured photo by "}, {"num_of_comments": 24, "num_of_like": "346,791", "path": "instagram/picture3789.jpg", "like_list": [], "date_time": "Aug 15, 2014", "location": "", "tag_list": ["@carolinavd", "@carolinavd", "@carolinavd"], "caption": "\u201cAlthough I\u2019m now officially a Finnish citizen, I often still feel as though I\u2019ve just moved here,\u201d says S\u00e3o Paulo native Ana Carolina Vieira (), who moved to Helsinki after falling in love 10 years ago. \u201cThe midnight sun during the summer and the snowy landscapes in the winter still amaze me every time.\u201d As a decorator, Ana Carolina believes her visual aesthetic has evolved in her new home. \u201cLong winters take up the vast majority of the year, making things naturally monochrome.
