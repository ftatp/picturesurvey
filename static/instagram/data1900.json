Use Boomerang to capture a satisfying final touch, like the last loop to close a flower.\nSet your phone or camera on a steady surface (or a tripod) and envision the fixed frame as a blank page to be filled. Think big: If you point your lens at an empty sidewalk, fill the entire frame with chalk art.\nChallenge yourself to try something new. For example, have a friend record your attempt to draw with your eyes closed or draw an urban scene without letting yourself lift your drawing utensil from the surface you\u2019re drawing on. Be sure your video shows the context that makes your drawing experiment unique.\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the  hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project.
