Let your creativity run wild. Next, think about the effect of a single balloon compared to a group and what they\u2019ll look in like in different places. A lone balloon in an unexpected location tells a very different story that large groupings assembled for a party. Finally, from the process of inflation, a struggle against the wind to the final pop, balloons move in interesting ways. Keep these in mind for video\u2014and don\u2019t forget the balloons can be filled with more than just air.\n\nPROJECT RULES: Please only add the  hashtag to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own photographs and videos to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights.

Some tips to get you started:\nFrom the preparation and pouring of the tea to the surroundings, company and conversation, many elements make up the ritual of teatime. Bring the elements of those rituals together and capture the moment through video. For photos, seek out soft window light, spend time arranging the details of your table and explore different angles as you shoot. Finally, don't be afraid to experiment. Get dressed up and stage a tea party somewhere unexpected, unearth vintage tea cups in a thrift store and let your caffeine-fueled creativity run wild.\n\nPROJECT RULES: Please only add the  hashtag to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own photographs and videos to the project. Any tagged image or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured Monday morning.\n\nFor more examples and inspiration, check out blog.instagram.com.\nFeatured photo by "}, {"num_of_comments": 24, "num_of_like": "539,988", "path": "instagram/picture3697.jpg", "like_list": [], "date_time": "Sep 26, 2014", "location": "Willemstad, Netherlands Antilles", "tag_list": ["@sandandstilettos", "@arangold2003"], "caption": "One of the first things visitors notice about Willemstad, the capitol of Cura\u00e7ao, is its brightly colored houses.

Visitors flock to Willemstad from all over the world to participate. \"Pride events on the island are getting bigger and better every year,\" says Gaby. \"Cura\u00e7aoans always know how to throw a good party.\" For more vivid landscapes and architecture from Willemstad, tap the blue location text above.
