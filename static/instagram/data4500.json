Though many argue what exactly defines jazz music, it is marked by extensive improvisation and expressive, \"blue notes.\" Over the last century, jazz has seen a vibrant evolution from the Jazz Age of the 1920s and 30s with its figureheads like Louis Armstrong. As jazz became more popular in the United States, it also expanded to Europe and beyond with artists like Django Reinhardt gaining notoriety. As the decades progressed, sub-genres such as smooth jazz and jazz fusion emerged, each with their own top performers as well.\n\nToday, jazz encompasses a sweeping range of styles with many artists varying throughout their career or adopting jazz influences in rock and pop music.

In this series, Instagrammers take photos of the exterior walls\u2014or facades\u2014of a large building from straight on and crop out the building's edges. This angle results in a geometric, almost abstract photo made entirely out of walls and windows. Now it's your turn. The goal this weekend is to take your own creative facade photo. Some tips to get you started: This project is all about lines and patterns. Take time to make sure your lines are straight, even and parallel with the edges of the frame to master the effect. When possible, try to take your photo from a few floors up in a building across the street. This helps minimize street-level interruptions and lets you fill your frame with the wall you're shooting. Though it may seem like facades don't change, keep an eye on light and shadows. Between light reflecting off glass and shadows cast by windowsills and balconies, there can be a lot of variation throughout the day. Finally, with a strong grid as the basis for your photo, anything that breaks it becomes a focal point. Use this to your advantage as you shoot.\n\nPROJECT RULES: Please only add the  hashtag to photos taken over this weekend and only submit your own photographs to the project.
