Some tips to get you started:\n\nThe make-or-break part of shooting any interior is the light. Shoot when the space is flooded with soft, natural window light and turn off any electric lights you can control. Next, before you start shooting, take some time to declutter the space. If it's a room of your own, tidy up and make sure decorations are simply and elegantly arranged. Don't be afraid to rearrange your home to get the shot you want! Finally, pay careful attention to perspective and aim to keep vertical lines parallel. Many mobile phone cameras let you enable a grid when shooting. Turn it on to help you get your lines nice and straight.\n\nPROJECT RULES: Please only add the  hashtag to photos taken over this weekend and only submit your own photographs to the project.

Its striking architectural features include four towering minarets, marble and granite exterior facades, alabaster carvings, stained glass windows and a central dome inspired by the ancient crown worn by Kazan khans. With a capacity to accommodate 1,500 worshippers within and 10,000 more outside on the two adjacent pavilions, Kul Sharif is one of Europe\u2019s largest mosques.\nThe original Kul Sharif mosque was a cornerstone of the city\u2019s civic and religious activity in the 16th century until it was destroyed in 1552 during the conquests of Ivan the Terrible. Today, the new mosque stands as an important symbol for the city\u2019s Islamic past and for the region\u2019s vision as a peaceful home for its multiethnic populations.\nPhoto by "}, {"num_of_comments": 24, "num_of_like": "484,291", "path": "instagram/picture3891.jpg", "like_list": [], "date_time": "Jun 29, 2014", "location": "", "tag_list": ["@seblester", "@seblester", "@seblester"], "caption": "\"I suppose there is a 'letterform evangelist' aspect to my Instagram account,\" says illustrator and calligrapher Seb Lester (), \"but calligraphy has an immediacy, and most people seem to appreciate it on some level.\" \"Learning calligraphy is a wonderful journey through history for me,\" Seb explains. \u201cMy work blends my knowledge of the ancient art of calligraphy with my knowledge of modern design and technology.\" Sharing through Instagram, Seb says, mirrors this blending of the old and new. \"I think it's an excellent example of how well this ancient art form can translate to the Internet.\" To see more photos and videos of Seb's daily calligraphy creations, follow .\n\nVideo by "}, {"num_of_comments": 24, "num_of_like": "277,251", "path": "instagram/picture3892.jpg", "like_list": [], "date_time": "Jun 28, 2014", "location": "", "tag_list": ["#WHPstreetstyle", "#WHPstreetstyle", "@the_line_up"], "caption": "Weekend Hashtag Project: \n\nThe goal this weekend is to break out of your comfort zone and capture the style of a passerby in public, whether it's punk, preppy or anywhere in-between. Some tips to get you started:\n\nBefore you start shooting, figure out your location and think about the lighting so you can quickly position yourself when it comes time to take the photo. Try starting by complimenting a person on their style. Strike up a conversation and be respectful\u2014if they say \"no,\" thank them and seek out someone else. Finally, if you talk to the person you've photographed, don't forget to ask if they're on Instagram. If they are, tag them in your photo so they can see the result!\n\nPROJECT RULES: Please only add the  hashtag to photos taken over this weekend and only submit your own photographs to the project. Any image taken then tagged over the weekend is eligible to be featured right here Monday morning!\nFor more examples and inspiration, check out blog.instagram.com.\nFeatured photo by "}, {"num_of_comments": 24, "num_of_like": "423,182", "path": "instagram/picture3893.jpg", "like_list": [], "date_time": "Jun 27, 2014", "location": "", "tag_list": ["@ledavolli", "@ledavolli"], "caption": "The experience of living abroad has been a magical one for Brazil Instagrammer Leticia Davolli (), who has called Toronto home for the last five years. \u201cAll of a sudden, you see the world through the eyes of a foreigner,\" she says. \"You never belong to a single place again.\" \"When I first moved to Toronto, I created the blog Para Minha M\u00e3e, translating to 'For My Mother' as a way to share my experiences in Toronto with my mom.\"\nLeticia is especially fascinated by Toronto\u2019s independent caf\u00e9 scene. \u201cPeople gather there to find inspiration and connect with others,\" she says. \u201cMy mother also loves coffee shops.
